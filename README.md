# mastermind

A game of mastermind against the computer utilizing a number of different algorithms

## Backend

The game of Mastermind and the algorithms are written in Python and can be found in `src/`. Run 
`mastermind.py` for a (very minimalistic and computer optimized) game of Mastermind. You can run each algorithm simply
by running a module in `src/algorithm/`. There are no dependencies.
